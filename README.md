# EPS Preview Ripper

Tool for extracting the metafile and tiff preview images embedded in EPS files generated by certain Windows applications.

## Technical

EPS with preview will have a binary header where the first four bytes are the magic number 0xC5D0D3C6.

Byte 16 of the header contains the offset to the metafile, followed by its size in bytes.
Byte 20 of the header contains the offset to the tiff, followed by its size in bytes.

These values are all 32bit unsigned integers in little endian order.
